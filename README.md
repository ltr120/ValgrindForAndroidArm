This is valgrind cross-compiled for Android arm using toolchain from ndk-r10c. The script may not work for you but it is a good guide of what to do to cross-compile. If your Android device is using arm, then you can probably just use what I have under "valgrind-3.10.0/Inst". You can just copy everything under "valgrind-3.10.0/Inst" to your Android root directory (make sure you have permission to do so).
